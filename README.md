# DataIntensiveAndCloudComputing

This repository is to keep my progress for my class at temple, CIS 5517. I have created branches representing the different projects I worked on, and will add README's in the branches to better explain how they work. The assignments are:
  * Assignment 1 - Introduction to MapReduce
  * Assignment 2 - Using MapReduce to merge a large json based dataset
  * Assignment 3 - Converting Assignment 2 to run on Spark
