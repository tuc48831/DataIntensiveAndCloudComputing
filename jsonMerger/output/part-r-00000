An example would be artificially lifting someone\u2019s self-esteem based on anything other than merit. I don\u2019t believe in the unspoken, facile view current in academia that, to steal and misquote a bit from Keats, that\n\n\u201cDiversity is God, Racism the Devil,\u201d\u2014that is all\nYe need know on earth, and all ye need to know.\n\nYe actually need know much more. No, my brand of liberal views developed not directly from academia, but indirectly. One of the grad schools I attended offered reasonable health insurance for grad students, and another didn\u2019t. It was at the latter that I learned the truth about medicine having an inelastic demand curve (look it up). As such, medicine does not fit well into the free-market system. Over all, the US pays far more than necessary due to useless things, like insurance companies, drug advertising, and missed opportunity by the mostly Republican ban on the US colllectively bargaining with drug companies. Canada can, and that\u2019s why drugs are cheaper there. You don\u2019t realize it but your own Republican Party is seriously ripping you off.
