As many have pointed out, if her future salary were not enough to afford the rent in DC, then yes this criticism might have had a point, however her future salary will cover her rent so this criticism is of course silly.  \n\nIf her rise shows economic illiteracy...then pray what does the rise of Donald Trump (Tax cuts we can't afford to people who don't really need them).  Or the rise of blatantly racist republicans, or the rise of others who clearly don't understand history, economics, and science mean?\n\nRepublicans are always talking about how relatable Trump was to the working class, so why dump on a young woman struggling to make ends meet as she moves into a new job?  What is more relatable than that?  Even if you don't agree with her policies.","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"7044836518","forum":"thehill-v4","points":3,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2018-11-23T14:33:20","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"<p>I wish people would move out of my blue state, traffic is unbearable.</p>","id":"4198097649","createdAt":"2018-11-16T14:33:20","author":{"username":"rickdiazalbertini","about":"","name":"tik27","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"joinedAt":"2013-08-30T12:51:25","profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/rickdiazalbertini/","url":"","location":"","isPrivate":false,"signedUrl":"","isPrimary":true,"isAnonymous":false,"id":"70557729","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/rickdiazalbertini.jpg","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/7055/7729/avatar32.jpg?1377867087"},"isCustom":true,"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/rickdiazalbertini.jpg","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/7055/7729/avatar92.jpg?1377867087","large":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/rickdiazalbertini.jpg","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/7055/7729/avatar92.jpg?1377867087"}}},"media":[],"isSpam":false,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"isDeleted":false,"parent":4197948250,"isApproved":true,"isFlagged":false,"raw_message":"I wish people would move out of my blue state, traffic is unbearable.","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"7044836518","forum":"thehill-v4","points":0,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2018-11-23T14:32:54","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":1,"message":"<p>The GOP  HATES her so much.

Thirty years ago economists came up with an explanation termed 'Dutch Disease,' after the effects of North Sea gas on the Dutch economy; it goes like this.  The resource exports cause the country's currency to rise in value against other currencies.  This make the country's other export activities uncompetitive. Yet these other activities might have been the best vehicles for technological progress.\"\n\nFurthermore,  Natural resources (such as oil) tend to encourage civil war.  Whoever controls the oil, controls the wealth and can pay the most soldiers.... and the civil war cycle continues.\n\nIn essence, large resource rents (from oil or other natural resources) tend to make democracies malfunction.\n\nEconomists have found a pattern that \"Oil and other surpluses from natural resources are particularly unsuited to the pressures generated by electoral competition.  Without natural resource surpluses, democracies outgrow autocracies.\"\n\nOverall I would focus on the Chapter \"Natural Resources Trap\" chapter.\n\nSo, yea, I agree with you that natural resource extraction can often benefit only the elite of a society....  \n\nBut in terms of causation, I believe it is because the countries lack a proper democracy.  \n\nThe US has now issued rules for a its companies who invest in extracting natural resources from other countries.  Regarding it's focus on democracy, its labor conditions, how it treats its citizens... etc.....\n \nChina has not.  The Chinese have employed a \"We will not ask questions\" philosophy when negotiating oil extraction from areas like Africa and South America.  Thus the natural resources trap will likely continue as long as that practice goes unchecked.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I don't believe we should stop trying to promote growth to help those in poverty.  It just must be tailored to diversifying economies.. not pure resource extraction.\n\nExample --- AGOA (African Growth Opportunity Act)  involving unilateral tariff reductions to stimulate exports in Africa's poorest countries.","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"7044836518","forum":"thehill-v4","points":0,"moderationLabels":["links"],"isEdited":true,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2018-11-22T16:23:55","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":1,"message":"<p>she is going to be fun to watch as she implodes</p><p>hehe....</p>","id":"4196584544","createdAt":"2018-11-15T16:23:55","author":{"username":"disqus_uaO3FTtxco","about":"","name":"Russian Confusion","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"joinedAt":"2018-06-03T18:42:48","profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/disqus_uaO3FTtxco/","url":"","location":"","isPrivate":true,"signedUrl":"","isPrimary":true,"isAnonymous":false,"id":"289241063","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/disqus_uaO3FTtxco.jpg","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/28924/1063/avatar32.jpg?1541881108"},"isCustom":true,"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/disqus_uaO3FTtxco.jpg","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/28924/1063/avatar92.jpg?1541881108","large":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/disqus_uaO3FTtxco.jpg","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/28924/1063/avatar92.jpg?1541881108"}}},"media":[],"isSpam":false,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"isDeleted":false,"parent":null,"isApproved":true,"isFlagged":false,"raw_message":"she is going to be fun to watch as she implodes\n\nhehe....","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"7044836518","forum":"thehill-v4","points":1,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2018-11-22T16:23:32","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":1,"message":"<p>She should go back to bartending.

Why does this joke of an op-ed writer think that most other civilized countries use it?  Even in the recent Rightwing study that said that \"it will cost 32 trillion dollars,\" it says in the footnotes that \"by the way, it saves 34 trillion dollars, because that's what we collectively pay currently in deductibles and premiums, and also it will be simpler and also cover everyone, but shhhhh, don't tell anyone.\"  <br>Nothing about Conservative economic models ever save money, because the entire goal is redistribution to the wealthy people that fund the \"think tanks\" and bribe the politicians to push these economic models.  That's why they want to rely on a private insurance model, because it allows a worthless middleman to skim money off the top as they scour through your paperwork for typos so they can deny you care after 30 years of you paying your premiums.  It's all a scam, which is why the last Republican president to actually balance a budget was Eisenhower in 1958, and every Republican since has done nothing but increase the deficit, and then rob Entitlements and pensions.

OK - so, what is your plan?  How much is \"enough\" for you?\n\nAs for me, I propose a highly simplified plan.  Eliminate all existing socialized programs: Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, ACA subsidies, traditional welfare-style payments, SNAP, WIC, housing support, etc.  I would replace them with two programs: a single payer health care plan (not socializing delivery, just payment) and guaranteed basic income (nothing lavish, just enough to avoid poverty on all counts - food, shelter, clothing, etc).  That will keep everybody a healthy, potential member of the workforce.  It will also enable entrepreneurs to be able to take bigger risks in starting up new businesses - you don't fall quite so hard when you fail (I had to pull back from becoming an independent contractor prior to the ACA due to concerns over pre-existing conditions).

In this paper, we define the poor as those in the bottom fifth of the income distribution of a country, and empirically examine the relationship between growth in average incomes of the poor and growth in overall incomes, using a large sample of developed and developing countries spanning the last four decades. Since average incomes of the\npoor are proportional to the share of income accruing to the poorest quintile times average income, this approach is equivalent to studying how a particular measure of income inequality -- the first quintile share -- varies with average incomes.","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"7044836518","forum":"thehill-v4","points":0,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2018-11-21T20:29:06","dislikes":1,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"<p>Non-Taxpayers dislike tax cuts but won't discuss spending cuts.
