She needs to step aside gracefully rather than split the party and the base. When half of Democrats don't want you as speaker, it's time to let someone else step up. Attempting to impeach Trump would be very bad for the party and would fail miserably. So anyone wanting a Speaker who will attempt impeachment needs to do a reality check. It will not have the votes in the House and will be laughed out of the Senate. Trump is here for the next 2 years and probably 4 more years after that.
