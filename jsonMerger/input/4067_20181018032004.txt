We are 10000 years from the last ice age, so make the most of this warm, benign pause before the next one. Human activity must be having some effect on the world, but as we don't know what the natural variability of the climate is, it is impossible to attribute human effects.The UN does not take into account natural variability, the sun etc but was set up to provide \"evidence\" that only man is responsible for climate change; all forecasts based on that premise have failed to come to pass.

I didn't say that. You did.\n\nTrump has been a well known public figure for the past 40-odd years. Trump was always ridiculously egotistical but it used to be possible to say to his face, \"You know that's not true\" when he spouted some spontaneous lie & he would actually agree that you were right, drop it & go on without missing a beat. He LOVES to test what he can get away with.\nBut now with Trump's \"Base\" eating up every random idiocy that spills from his lips it's ludicrous.\nTrump is the Sun at the center of his own Universe. He makes everything up as he goes along. His believers take it for Gospel Truth BECAUSE HE TELLS THEM WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR. Compared to Trump, truth tellers are a drag!\nAmerica's been dumbed down to a level no one would ever have thought possible. Except maybe Donald Trump, in his fantasies.

I'm a science graduate and I understand the scientific method in depth. Donald Trump hasn't got a clue about even the basics of the scientific method. When Trump says \"you have scientists on both sides\" this absolutely proves that Trump has not got the slightest knowledge of science. In science, it's the evidence that matters not what someone says about it. The motto of the Royal Society, the oldest scientific institute in the world is \"Nullius in verba\", which essentially means don't take my word for it, to refute the appeal to authority. The thing is that the few scientists who disagree with climate change theory, have got no real evidence to back up what they say."},{"userAlias":"TrumpOurTriumph","assetHeadline":"'We're doomed': Social media users predict the worst for mankind after Trump says he has a 'natural instinct for science' ","userLocation":"In Trump we Trust, United States","formattedDateAndTime":"8 hours ago","assetId":6288191,"replies":{"totalCount":2,"comments":[{"userAlias":"Cluster","assetHeadline":"'We're doomed': Social media users predict the worst for mankind after Trump says he has a 'natural instinct for science' ","userLocation":"Somewhere out West, United States","formattedDateAndTime":"7 hours ago","assetId":6288191,"replies":{"totalCount":0,"comments":[]},"voteCount":45,"id":358601351,"userIdentifier":"1498527297475447","hasProfilePicture":false,"voteRating":35,"dateCreated":"2018-10-18T00:50:34.653Z","assetCommentCount":205,"assetUrl":"/news/article-6288191/Social-media-users-predict-worst-Trump-says-natural-instinct-science.html","message":"Bwahahaha such a sense of sick humor.
