I am a native born American who embraces opportunity for all. I fervently believe the US remains the beacon for the world though that beacon will be a dim as long as we continue these overseas follies. Our nation does best when we help each other at home as well as others in dire need outside our boundaries. Only as an absolute last resort should the lethal might of our nation be unleashed on other peoples, no matter the religion, ideology or demonic nature. I am a fiscal conservative, religious conservative but not one who will impose my will on others free to make their own choice though I WILL forever speak for the unborn. I am my brother's keeper!                       This past New Year's eve I rode an ovenight MP shift at a nearby military base. These young men & women who are continuously doing the most important things of their lives throughout the world took this one night to assure the safety of their fellow troops reveling on the base and nearby communities. Just before midnight dispatch came up on the net with a countdown followed by greetings from a few of the patrol units. And then came a final greeting in military phonetics; Hotel.....November.....Yankee. Only in the military is something so cryptic so inspiring.Next year I plan to do the same ride but intend to bring something special for those on duty as well as those hospitalized.
