They may have advertised this in \"One market, one money\" as brining equality of living standards, pay and pensions across the Eurozone but they knew the opposite would be true from their ERM experience and they counted on iot. (See \"The Rotten Heart of Europe\" by Bernard Connolly).<br>But to pretend they are immune to the pressures that economics brings to the key players would also be a mistake., if not for the economnic effects then for the political. German industrialists are warning that a no deal brexit could cost German car manufacturers 1800 jobs, for example. And German, normally relied on as the \"leader\" of the EU is growing its own populist approach and Mrs Merkel is suffering badly, so much so she must resign as leader of her  party, though somehow she thinks she can remain Chancellor, and into this vaccum we see the vacuous macron stepping up and making his bid to be seen as the European leader.</p><p>And yes, Britain leaving will cost them the second largest contributor with little say in events, and the worlds fifth largest economy and no one can really pretend this doesn't hurt the EU economically, but also politically. Their credibility is at risk and their economy significantly diminished.</p><p>On contributions they have the three options none of which is politically good news:<br>1) cut their budgets and the political aspirations those budgets support<br>2) expect their net contributors o make up the shortfall.... how does that play politically? How does it feed into the increasingly populist Germany?<br>3) cut payments to the net recipients.

They may have advertised this in \"One market, one money\" as brining equality of living standards, pay and pensions across the Eurozone but they knew the opposite would be true from their ERM experience and they counted on iot. (See \"The Rotten Heart of Europe\" by Bernard Connolly).\nBut to pretend they are immune to the pressures that economics brings to the key players would also be a mistake., if not for the economnic effects then for the political. German industrialists are warning that a no deal brexit could cost German car manufacturers 1800 jobs, for example. And German, normally relied on as the \"leader\" of the EU is growing its own populist approach and Mrs Merkel is suffering badly, so much so she must resign as leader of her  party, though somehow she thinks she can remain Chancellor, and into this vaccum we see the vacuous macron stepping up and making his bid to be seen as the European leader. \n\nAnd yes, Britain leaving will cost them the second largest contributor with little say in events, and the worlds fifth largest economy and no one can really pretend this doesn't hurt the EU economically, but also politically. Their credibility is at risk and their economy significantly diminished. \n\nOn contributions they have the three options none of which is politically good news:\n1) cut their budgets and the political aspirations those budgets support\n2) expect their net contributors o make up the shortfall.... how does that play politically? How does it feed into the increasingly populist Germany?\n3) cut payments to the net recipients. It may be why there is a new emphasis on financial penalties for the more populist outspoken members of the block, an attempt to serve both goals and claim \"they have brought it on themselves\" rather than \"we don't have the UK contributions any more. \n\nFinancial services.... yes and within the EU the continued presence of the Uk would allow Farnkfurt to assume more and more of those services, a long term goal and of course, the Bundesbank loathes the currency market, not unsurprisingly, and that would be regulated as fast and as strongly as possible. \n\n\n\nBut politically the biggest con of the EU is that it is, as De Gaulle, once claimed \"France and Germany with the rest as Trimmings\" except it really has been germany all along with the French thinking they have influence where they have none except what germany has allowed them and it has been Germany that in the ERM days protected the French from their own follies by revaluing rather than see France devalue as much as it should.... and at the expense of others.

It is notable how the entire establishment, particularly the media, did not and do not point out the issues I raise here. They create problems when there are none, chaos has been manufactured and this has been evident the length and breadth of the media with each and every mainstream paper, magazine and news show.</p><p>Trade was (and remains) the key. Theresa May threw the card away, and everything she has done since has been playing catch-up, not least because by ignoring trade it has repeatedly been more easily spun by Remain's media that the EU have all the cards despite its slow train wreck implosion, which again the BBC ignores; trump card after trump card has landed on the porch at Number 10. They have all been ignored, not just by this government but also by a cynical media. Trade was (and remains) the key. Theresa May threw it away, our key card: the fact the EU buys only half as much as it sells to us, the trade deficit. Can anyone recall hearing her even mention that? The fact should have been a negotiation headline. It was barely breathed.</p><p>Instead, a climate has been engineered where everything \"looks bleak\" for post-Brexit Britain, or where all the good news - such as that our economy remains healthier than that of the EU - is \"despite Brexit\".</p><p>The Leave campaign won the campaign to change fundamentally our country, but an establishment that deigns itself superior to the people stole that win and has systematically crushed it underfoot into the ground.</p><p>... This isn't a cock-up, people, it was planned, cajoled, division sown, the electorate worn down. The effect to the national psyche, one might add, amounts to a kind of water torture. You tell me, are people more or less happy for experiencing this process? Is it right or wrong to toy with people's nerves, lives, families and culture? There are many interesting questions that arise here about what constitutes abuse from state to population.</p><p>And now, not one but two Brexit Secretaries have resigned, frustrated by a Prime Minister that sidelined them in favor of having an unelected EU fanboy civil servant lead the talks with Barnier. That alone should be sickening enough to anyone who cares about accountable government. Davis had, what, two or maybe three meetings with Barnier? He said there simply was no point, that the civil service, politicised by a certain Tony Blair, had been placed in charge, and it is notable that Blair just this week has gleefully praised Robbins for his role in what to you or I surely resembles a disaster. Raab found no different in his petty role, he explained yesterday. The newly-created position of Brexit Secretary, given the times, should have been amongst the most revered in government, yet its occupant might as well have been Larry the cat. Our Brexit Secretaries were not there for Brexit, they were mere tinsel appointed by May to fool the public that she was listening to Brexiteers and that they had a role in the future of the country. It was a spiteful, unforgivable deceit.</p><p>If the Tories were public servants they would depose this distraction, today, and offer us a Brexiteering Prime Minister to say to the EU what should have been said from the start: \"Talk trade or we walk, but talk trade and we will make a settlement which will help us all. We will leave the EU on 29th March 11pm GMT so we will just have to do the best we can so, EUrope, do you want to trade?\"</p><p>The above was a lot easier to say two years ago, we have had our time wasted, with scant attention to domestic and other foreign affairs, for all this time, a far from conservative waste of our national opportunity. But we have no choice but to say it, to insist upon a basis of trade talks, else it's no deal, if we care to safeguard our national interest and not just in the foreseeable but more importantly in the longer term.</p><p>The question today is, has the judgement of Tory MPs sufficiently improved since May's election? I doubt it very much, though spectacles such as May's nationally embarrassing mocking in the Commons do seem to be educating a few as to the stakes involved, at last. Many, the many Soubreys, need kicking out entirely. Their contempt for those that gave them power proves that party politics does not work in its current form, that it is grossly unrepresentative, that constituents are often colour-blinded, special interests given priority, and so it goes on.</p><p>I expect to see them engineer an extension to Article 50. I see no Brexit thereafter unless somehow we fluke \"no deal\". Estimations would change given a different leader. Eliminating the prospect of another fraud like Rudd, estimations would improve.</p><p>That's been the path of the last two years, and that's where it has brought us, which is practically nowhere. And that has been the plan from the very day Theresa May threw her hat into the leadership ring. She is indeed a traitor, and she is far from being the boss.</p>","id":"4197800157","createdAt":"2018-11-16T10:05:08","author":{"username":"realollyconnelly","about":"Producer, Daily Brexit","name":"Olly Connelly","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"joinedAt":"2018-03-08T13:08:05","profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/realollyconnelly/","url":"https://dailybrexit.uk","location":"","isPrivate":false,"signedUrl":"https://disq.us/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdailybrexit.uk&key=qkkixokJL1pzwBFB7xe0Kw","isPrimary":true,"isAnonymous":false,"id":"282166260","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/realollyconnelly.jpg","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/28216/6260/avatar32.jpg?1541730997"},"isCustom":true,"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/realollyconnelly.jpg","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/28216/6260/avatar92.jpg?1541730997","large":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/realollyconnelly.jpg","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/28216/6260/avatar92.jpg?1541730997"}}},"media":[],"isSpam":false,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"isDeleted":false,"parent":4197217992,"isApproved":true,"isFlagged":false,"raw_message":"well, this is the last 2 years ...\n\nThe hard truth is this: the establishment have done and will do everything in their power to preserve their fiefdom, and it is not in their personal interest to leave this globalist disingenuity the EU.\n\nWhere we are today was exactly what we could expect when, rather than reflect the wishes of their constituents, Conservative MPs elected a Prime Minister that, far from reflecting the majority vision, was someone from the losing Remain camp.

Theresa May threw the card away, and everything she has done since has been playing catch-up, not least because by ignoring trade it has repeatedly been more easily spun by Remain's media that the EU have all the cards despite its slow train wreck implosion, which again the BBC ignores; trump card after trump card has landed on the porch at Number 10. They have all been ignored, not just by this government but also by a cynical media. Trade was (and remains) the key. Theresa May threw it away, our key card: the fact the EU buys only half as much as it sells to us, the trade deficit. Can anyone recall hearing her even mention that? The fact should have been a negotiation headline. It was barely breathed.\n\nInstead, a climate has been engineered where everything \"looks bleak\" for post-Brexit Britain, or where all the good news - such as that our economy remains healthier than that of the EU - is \"despite Brexit\".\n\nThe Leave campaign won the campaign to change fundamentally our country, but an establishment that deigns itself superior to the people stole that win and has systematically crushed it underfoot into the ground.\n\n... This isn't a cock-up, people, it was planned, cajoled, division sown, the electorate worn down. The effect to the national psyche, one might add, amounts to a kind of water torture. You tell me, are people more or less happy for experiencing this process? Is it right or wrong to toy with people's nerves, lives, families and culture? There are many interesting questions that arise here about what constitutes abuse from state to population.\n\nAnd now, not one but two Brexit Secretaries have resigned, frustrated by a Prime Minister that sidelined them in favor of having an unelected EU fanboy civil servant lead the talks with Barnier. That alone should be sickening enough to anyone who cares about accountable government. Davis had, what, two or maybe three meetings with Barnier? He said there simply was no point, that the civil service, politicised by a certain Tony Blair, had been placed in charge, and it is notable that Blair just this week has gleefully praised Robbins for his role in what to you or I surely resembles a disaster. Raab found no different in his petty role, he explained yesterday. The newly-created position of Brexit Secretary, given the times, should have been amongst the most revered in government, yet its occupant might as well have been Larry the cat. Our Brexit Secretaries were not there for Brexit, they were mere tinsel appointed by May to fool the public that she was listening to Brexiteers and that they had a role in the future of the country. It was a spiteful, unforgivable deceit.\n\nIf the Tories were public servants they would depose this distraction, today, and offer us a Brexiteering Prime Minister to say to the EU what should have been said from the start: \"Talk trade or we walk, but talk trade and we will make a settlement which will help us all. We will leave the EU on 29th March 11pm GMT so we will just have to do the best we can so, EUrope, do you want to trade?\"\n\nThe above was a lot easier to say two years ago, we have had our time wasted, with scant attention to domestic and other foreign affairs, for all this time, a far from conservative waste of our national opportunity. But we have no choice but to say it, to insist upon a basis of trade talks, else it's no deal, if we care to safeguard our national interest and not just in the foreseeable but more importantly in the longer term.\n\nThe question today is, has the judgement of Tory MPs sufficiently improved since May's election? I doubt it very much, though spectacles such as May's nationally embarrassing mocking in the Commons do seem to be educating a few as to the stakes involved, at last. Many, the many Soubreys, need kicking out entirely. Their contempt for those that gave them power proves that party politics does not work in its current form, that it is grossly unrepresentative, that constituents are often colour-blinded, special interests given priority, and so it goes on.\n\nI expect to see them engineer an extension to Article 50. I see no Brexit thereafter unless somehow we fluke \"no deal\". Estimations would change given a different leader. Eliminating the prospect of another fraud like Rudd, estimations would improve.\n\nThat's been the path of the last two years, and that's where it has brought us, which is practically nowhere. And that has been the plan from the very day Theresa May threw her hat into the leadership ring. She is indeed a traitor, and she is far from being the boss.","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"7048169021","forum":"breitbartproduction","points":0,"moderationLabels":["badWords"],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2018-11-23T10:02:58","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":10,"message":"<p>We have Gerard Batten.<br>And the public just kicks him in the teeth and British media have blacklisted him.<br>He is too good for them - won't be bullied - so they have completely refused to cover him although he is the leader of UKIP.</p>","id":"4197798251","createdAt":"2018-11-16T10:02:58","author":{"username":"EmilyEnso","about":"","name":"EmilyEnso","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"joinedAt":"2011-04-11T12:16:55","profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/EmilyEnso/","url":"","location":"","isPrivate":false,"signedUrl":"","isPrimary":true,"isAnonymous":false,"id":"9037363","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/EmilyEnso.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1541535443/images/noavatar32.png"},"isCustom":false,"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/EmilyEnso.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1541535443/images/noavatar92.png","large":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/EmilyEnso.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1541535443/images/noavatar92.png"}}},"media":[],"isSpam":false,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"isDeleted":false,"parent":4197677156,"isApproved":true,"isFlagged":false,"raw_message":"We have Gerard Batten.\nAnd the public just kicks him in the teeth and British media have blacklisted him.\nHe is too good for them - won't be bullied - so they have completely refused to cover him although he is the leader of UKIP.","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"7048169021","forum":"breitbartproduction","points":10,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2018-11-23T10:00:57","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"<p>Does anyone know why Gove stabbed Johnson in the back and destroyed his leadership bid after the referendum?

They have none.\n\n\nNeither do people with the sorts of personality disorder that render them useful in politics marketing and PR. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Britain Needs, and what Britain Should, Or Ought To Have, or do are simply cat belling fantasies. \n\n\n\nWe all know twhat te problem is. We moved on years ago. The question is how to achieve a real world solution.\n\n\nThat is not so easy and I wouldn't waste a hypothetical bullet on Theresa May. She's just another pathetic unloved and unlovely little sociopath that sold her soul for her 15 minutes of fame, and finally got noticed.\n\n\nApparatchik to the core. Ten a penny are the TM the PMs.\n\n\nThe job is to disentangle  the tentacles of the Deep State EU from Britain, not because of fantasy freedoms and the like but simply because its more likely to kill Europe  and Britain and ultimately its parasitic self through utter incompetence, than  make Europe great.\n\n\nYou live in a nice simple country that is small enough you know what goes on pretty much .\n\n\nThis is a BIG country with wheels within wheels within wheels where no one knows really how it all works or how to control or direct it, They just think they do. And that belief is very dangerous. \n\n\n\nBecause they meddle with stuff that works without understanding why it works or even what it is for...\n\n\nAnd they break stiff.  We are here, now, in this time, in this situation because the EU has already failed. \n\n\n\nIt has failed to make us love it. It has failed to deliver prosperity to its satellite states - only to Germany and Benelux. It has failed to stop wars within its enclaves. It has failed in its economic policy of the Euro. It is failing with its renewable energy policy. It has failed to stop brexit.\n\n\nAnd with Brexit, it has failed to look after the interests of its core supporters - European businesses. Who want a flat market, single currency,  harmonised standards, trade barriers to non EU goods,  free movement of cheap labour or EU grants to move their factories to where it is, or freedom to import it from the third world.\n\n\nThey are fat lazy incompetent and far too powerful.\n\n\nBut they are too incompetent to make it work.\n\n\nBrexit ahas been run by the EU. Not by leavers. And they have bungled it.\n\n\nMay is their creature. She will be sacrificed on the altar  of expediency as soon as she fails to to deliver their deal. Or indeed as soon as she has!\n\n\n\nWe don't have to knife her in the back. They will.\n\n\nThey have messed up big time Now the 'parliament must approve any deal' of Ms Stupid Miller is enshrined in law, they cant get the thing through parliament/. In fact we Brexiteers owe a huge debt to Ms Miller - because there is no conceivable deal possible that WILL get through parliament.\n\n\nLeaving no deal as really the only option, which is why every news outlet refers to it ton tines of shock dismay and utter horror,.
