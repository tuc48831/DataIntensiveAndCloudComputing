It's sure looking like it from my view point .\nHillary is closing in on the White House and not in a jail cell. \nLaws are only enforced on private citizens.\nThis cuontry may go by the name of The United States of America but it's certainly not United any longer. \nThere's 2 factions now . \n#1 - We have the ruling class deeo state comprised of government employees who are judged by a different set of standards and laws  \n#2 -  There is us the people who no longer have fair and honest elections.  Our election system no longer reflects the will of the people and the ruling class has become so bold they now rig the vote in view of the public.\nCriminal ( Hillary and many others) politicians are free walking and campaigning instead of being put behind bars  \nThis is a banana Republic and our vote our power to govern and our freedom isn't even an illusion any longer .
