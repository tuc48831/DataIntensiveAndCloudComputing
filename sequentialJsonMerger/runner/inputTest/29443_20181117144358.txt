That w/regulation cuts has produced jobs &amp; brought businesses back. Supply Side Economics work. Poor people don't birth/grow businesses &amp; employ workers. Problem is as soon as it starts to take hold Democrats get back in power. 4) Banks &amp; Automakers need oversight before they get to the hand out phase. 5) Frankly, I'm not that concerned about the rest of the world. We give reasonable tax payer financial aid to other countries &amp; we're a giving people in the secular relm. Being \" Santa Claus\" to the world, along w/our obligations here, has us $21 trillion in debt. The bulk of NATO costs has been falling on us, which enables Europe to let us fund their social programs along w/our own. Throwing the borders wide open &amp; raising immigrants cradle to grave is no longer feasible. Some of us have been paying the country's bills since the 70's, w/one tax cut in the 80's, until Trump.
