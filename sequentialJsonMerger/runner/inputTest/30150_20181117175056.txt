I am a native born American who embraces opportunity for all. I fervently believe the US remains the beacon for the world though that beacon will be a dim as long as we continue these overseas follies. Our nation does best when we help each other at home as well as others in dire need outside our boundaries. Only as an absolute last resort should the lethal might of our nation be unleashed on other peoples, no matter the religion, ideology or demonic nature. I am a fiscal conservative, religious conservative but not one who will impose my will on others free to make their own choice though I WILL forever speak for the unborn. I am my brother's keeper!                       This past New Year's eve I rode an ovenight MP shift at a nearby military base. These young men & women who are continuously doing the most important things of their lives throughout the world took this one night to assure the safety of their fellow troops reveling on the base and nearby communities. Just before midnight dispatch came up on the net with a countdown followed by greetings from a few of the patrol units. And then came a final greeting in military phonetics; Hotel.....November.....Yankee. Only in the military is something so cryptic so inspiring.Next year I plan to do the same ride but intend to bring something special for those on duty as well as those hospitalized.

I am a native born American who embraces opportunity for all. I fervently believe the US remains the beacon for the world though that beacon will be a dim as long as we continue these overseas follies. Our nation does best when we help each other at home as well as others in dire need outside our boundaries. Only as an absolute last resort should the lethal might of our nation be unleashed on other peoples, no matter the religion, ideology or demonic nature. I am a fiscal conservative, religious conservative but not one who will impose my will on others free to make their own choice though I WILL forever speak for the unborn. I am my brother's keeper!                       This past New Year's eve I rode an ovenight MP shift at a nearby military base. These young men & women who are continuously doing the most important things of their lives throughout the world took this one night to assure the safety of their fellow troops reveling on the base and nearby communities. Just before midnight dispatch came up on the net with a countdown followed by greetings from a few of the patrol units. And then came a final greeting in military phonetics; Hotel.....November.....Yankee. Only in the military is something so cryptic so inspiring.Next year I plan to do the same ride but intend to bring something special for those on duty as well as those hospitalized.

I am a native born American who embraces opportunity for all. I fervently believe the US remains the beacon for the world though that beacon will be a dim as long as we continue these overseas follies. Our nation does best when we help each other at home as well as others in dire need outside our boundaries. Only as an absolute last resort should the lethal might of our nation be unleashed on other peoples, no matter the religion, ideology or demonic nature. I am a fiscal conservative, religious conservative but not one who will impose my will on others free to make their own choice though I WILL forever speak for the unborn. I am my brother's keeper!                       This past New Year's eve I rode an ovenight MP shift at a nearby military base. These young men & women who are continuously doing the most important things of their lives throughout the world took this one night to assure the safety of their fellow troops reveling on the base and nearby communities. Just before midnight dispatch came up on the net with a countdown followed by greetings from a few of the patrol units. And then came a final greeting in military phonetics; Hotel.....November.....Yankee.

I am a native born American who embraces opportunity for all. I fervently believe the US remains the beacon for the world though that beacon will be a dim as long as we continue these overseas follies. Our nation does best when we help each other at home as well as others in dire need outside our boundaries. Only as an absolute last resort should the lethal might of our nation be unleashed on other peoples, no matter the religion, ideology or demonic nature. I am a fiscal conservative, religious conservative but not one who will impose my will on others free to make their own choice though I WILL forever speak for the unborn. I am my brother's keeper!                       This past New Year's eve I rode an ovenight MP shift at a nearby military base. These young men & women who are continuously doing the most important things of their lives throughout the world took this one night to assure the safety of their fellow troops reveling on the base and nearby communities. Just before midnight dispatch came up on the net with a countdown followed by greetings from a few of the patrol units. And then came a final greeting in military phonetics; Hotel.....November.....Yankee.

I am a native born American who embraces opportunity for all. I fervently believe the US remains the beacon for the world though that beacon will be a dim as long as we continue these overseas follies. Our nation does best when we help each other at home as well as others in dire need outside our boundaries. Only as an absolute last resort should the lethal might of our nation be unleashed on other peoples, no matter the religion, ideology or demonic nature. I am a fiscal conservative, religious conservative but not one who will impose my will on others free to make their own choice though I WILL forever speak for the unborn. I am my brother's keeper!                       This past New Year's eve I rode an ovenight MP shift at a nearby military base. These young men & women who are continuously doing the most important things of their lives throughout the world took this one night to assure the safety of their fellow troops reveling on the base and nearby communities. Just before midnight dispatch came up on the net with a countdown followed by greetings from a few of the patrol units. And then came a final greeting in military phonetics; Hotel.....November.....Yankee. Only in the military is something so cryptic so inspiring.Next year I plan to do the same ride but intend to bring something special for those on duty as well as those hospitalized.

As of now, 2,600 asylum requests were being processed, the minister added.\n\nMexico's low-paying factories at times struggle to find workers, and the border area is suffering chronic labor shortages.\n\nWELCOMING HISTORY\n\nTensions began brewing in Tijuana a few days ago when residents complained about a group of 80 or so LGBT migrants who broke away from the caravan and arrived in an upscale part of the Playas de Tijuana neighborhood, near where the stones were thrown.\n\nA popular party town for U.S. tourists, Tijuana has a history of absorbing visitors, including Chinese immigrants in the 19th century. It has a large American population and some 3,000 Haitians settled in the city, just south of San Diego, in 2016 after failing to cross the U.S. border.\n\nBut the arrival of hundreds of members of the caravans has stretched to the limit migrant shelters that were already overflowing with people. While Tijuana's traditional generosity was also on display, with the government setting up a new shelter and citizens offering food and clothing, a harder attitude also emerged.\n\nReuters gained access to a WhatsApp chat group called \"Citizen Blockade\" where some 250 members using strong language discussed strategies to harass the migrants or block their arrival.\n\nTijuana's city government opened a shelter for 360 people of an estimated 810 that arrived this week, and officials warned there was little room to house more than 2,000 more who are expected to arrive this week.\n\nIrineo Mujica, representative of the organization Pueblos Sin Fronteras, which is advising the migrants in the caravan, said the migrants wanted to seek asylum in the United States.\n\nTheir arrival adds to already long lines of people who have been waiting their turn at the Tijuana crossing. Last week, Trump suspended the granting of asylum to migrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\n\n\"We are looking for solutions, not confrontations,\" Mujica said following the clash with Mexicans as a helicopter hovered above, surveying the scene from the American side.","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"7051035847","forum":"thehill-v4","points":0,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2018-11-24T00:54:56","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":1,"message":"<p>Red states do not like having every citizen's vote count but times are changing kids</p>","id":"4199025463","createdAt":"2018-11-17T00:54:56","author":{"username":"disqus_SO3J7FRZi5","about":"Business owner","name":"Independent","disable3rdPartyTrackers":true,"isPowerContributor":false,"joinedAt":"2014-11-04T20:17:41","profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/disqus_SO3J7FRZi5/","url":"","location":"Denver, CO","isPrivate":true,"signedUrl":"","isPrimary":true,"isAnonymous":false,"id":"129808290","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar32.jpg?1495822997","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar32.jpg?1495822997"},"large":{"permalink":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar92.jpg?1495822997","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar92.jpg?1495822997"},"permalink":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar92.jpg?1495822997","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar92.jpg?1495822997"}},"media":[],"isSpam":false,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"isDeleted":false,"parent":null,"isApproved":true,"isFlagged":false,"raw_message":"Red states do not like having every citizen's vote count but times are changing kids","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"7051035847","forum":"thehill-v4","points":1,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2018-11-24T00:54:48","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"<p>Now the world can see, just corrupt the democrats are.</p>","id":"4199025327","createdAt":"2018-11-17T00:54:48","author":{"username":"arthurtoddorey","about":"","name":"OreysDream","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"joinedAt":"2013-10-23T17:53:33","profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/arthurtoddorey/","url":"","location":"","isPrivate":true,"signedUrl":"","isPrimary":true,"isAnonymous":false,"id":"78714882","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/arthurtoddorey.jpg","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/7871/4882/avatar32.jpg?1542480968"},"isCustom":true,"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/arthurtoddorey.jpg","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/7871/4882/avatar92.jpg?1542480968","large":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/arthurtoddorey.jpg","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/7871/4882/avatar92.jpg?1542480968"}}},"media":[],"isSpam":false,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"isDeleted":false,"parent":null,"isApproved":true,"isFlagged":false,"raw_message":"Now the world can see, just corrupt the democrats are.","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"7051035847","forum":"thehill-v4","points":0,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2018-11-24T00:54:37","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":6,"message":"<p>Lawsuits are crying.
