Because I am confused why you as a White Male who don't live anywhere near the South side of Chicago. Pretending  your so worried about being killed or those black men killing each other in the South side of Chicago. A place you never have to go so you don't have to worry about being killed. \n\nBut in the entire Country anywhere, hundreds of people are being shot and killed by 1 person at one time. An nowhere and nobody is safe but you don't care about this fact. Is it because the Killers Are White Males like yourself? An you don't want any awful or bad FACTS about The White Nationalist Male Domestic Terrorist mass shooter epidemic in this country. That since 911 over 88% of all the Domestic Terrorist attacks in America have been commited by WHITE MALES. \n\nSo you keep bringing up the gang violence issue in South side of Chicago because it's black people commiting the crimes? An somehow you making the false equivalency between South side of Chicago black male gang issue and the Domestic Terrorist mass shooters White Nationalist epidemic. To make the White Nationalist Domestic Terrorist mass shooter epidemic in this country, okay. Makes you feel better and able to excuse the FACT we have A EPIDEMIC Of WHITE MALES Commiting Domestic Terrorist attacks and mass shootings in America.\n\nHere is a fact the black males in the South side of Chicago who are evil killers. They're not even so evil that they are going into Churches, Elementary schools, Synagauage, and Movie theaters and killing hundreds of innocent women, men, and children for no reason. I bet you can't post the same about the White Nationalist Doemstic terrorist mass shooting White Males.","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"7039200339","forum":"thehill-v4","points":4,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":true,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2018-11-19T16:29:28","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"<p>No, waddling Ivan</p>","id":"4191292121","createdAt":"2018-11-12T16:29:28","author":{"username":"st_hh","about":"","name":"ST HH","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"joinedAt":"2018-07-23T16:33:22","profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/st_hh/","url":"","location":"","isPrivate":false,"signedUrl":"","isPrimary":true,"isAnonymous":false,"id":"292842000","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar32.jpg?1495822997","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar32.jpg?1495822997"},"large":{"permalink":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar92.jpg?1495822997","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar92.jpg?1495822997"},"permalink":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar92.jpg?1495822997","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar92.jpg?1495822997"}},"media":[],"isSpam":false,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"isDeleted":false,"parent":4191280642,"isApproved":true,"isFlagged":false,"raw_message":"No, waddling Ivan","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"7039200339","forum":"thehill-v4","points":0,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2018-11-19T16:29:09","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":1,"message":"<p>Go to bed, Ivan</p>","id":"4191291554","createdAt":"2018-11-12T16:29:09","author":{"username":"st_hh","about":"","name":"ST HH","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"joinedAt":"2018-07-23T16:33:22","profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/st_hh/","url":"","location":"","isPrivate":false,"signedUrl":"","isPrimary":true,"isAnonymous":false,"id":"292842000","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar32.jpg?1495822997","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar32.jpg?1495822997"},"large":{"permalink":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar92.jpg?1495822997","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar92.jpg?1495822997"},"permalink":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar92.jpg?1495822997","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar92.jpg?1495822997"}},"media":[],"isSpam":false,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"isDeleted":false,"parent":4191285131,"isApproved":true,"isFlagged":false,"raw_message":"Go to bed, Ivan","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"7039200339","forum":"thehill-v4","points":1,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2018-11-19T16:28:40","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"<p>And you apparently hated your Engrish teecher.</p>","id":"4191290769","createdAt":"2018-11-12T16:28:40","author":{"username":"disqus_6egbhjg5JO","about":"","name":"Danm","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"joinedAt":"2018-07-29T00:25:34","profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/disqus_6egbhjg5JO/","url":"","location":"","isPrivate":true,"signedUrl":"","isPrimary":true,"isAnonymous":false,"id":"293248907","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar32.jpg?1495822997","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar32.jpg?1495822997"},"large":{"permalink":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar92.jpg?1495822997","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar92.jpg?1495822997"},"permalink":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar92.jpg?1495822997","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/121/2423/avatar92.jpg?1495822997"}},"media":[],"isSpam":false,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"isDeleted":false,"parent":4191285754,"isApproved":true,"isFlagged":false,"raw_message":"And you apparently hated your Engrish teecher.","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"7039200339","forum":"thehill-v4","points":0,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"editableUntil":"2018-11-19T16:27:02","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"<p>It\u2019s been a week.
